# ChatGPT as a Voice Assistant for Scheduling

## What are we trying to improve?

In this project we experimented with AIs, APIs, and prompt engineering to find a way and address issues affecting time management and the elderly. By attaching a conversational input to ChatGPT, we aimed to make using the engine feel more natural to the user. This was a Summer Project using AI, voice recognition, TtS, and other features to help aid accessibility for scheduling in elderly care.

## What we did

We considered potential issues that those with disabilities and elderly may face when using a text-based system like ChatGPT, and discussed some features that may help to make the system easier to use.

Some features include:

- Direct voice recognition
- Simple UI
- Text-to-speech output

These features are then directly linked to ChatGPT.

## How to run

Needs python3 installed for primary libraries.
The libraries for python are included in requirements.txt; just run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in terminal.
Use your personal key instead when using: [https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session](https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session) (need to sign in to chatgpt account first.) and copy to line 45 of assist-time.py
Then run "python assist-time.py".
