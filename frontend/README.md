## Requirements
- npm (goto [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the LTS version)
- Expo Go (available as both Android and iOS app)

## How to run the app
In the terminal, navigate to the front end folder. Then run the following commands:
```sh
npm install
npx expo start
```
This should start the server on the computer and output a QR code. To access the app, make sure your phone (with Expo Go installed) is connected to the same network as your computer. For Android users, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code. iOS users should use the default QR code scanner. After that you should be able to see the app running.
